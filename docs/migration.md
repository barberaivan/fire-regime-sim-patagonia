# Migration checklist — fire_spread → fire-regime-sim-patagonia

Living tracker for migrating canonical code + data from the old PhD monorepo
(`~/Insync/Fire spread modelling/fire_spread/`) into this repo. Work happens in small,
independently committable tasks (T0…T11) so a session can pick up one task, verify it, commit,
and stop — cheap to resume later. Tick a task's checkbox in the list below when its commit lands.

**Principles:**
- **Copy, never move.** Originals in `fire_spread/` stay untouched until everything verifies.
  Applies to the store too (heavy data is copied in, renamed as needed).
- **Behavior-preserving now, refactor later.** No logic changes in this pass — no
  loop→function, no splitting big scripts. Those are deferred (see TODO register).
- **Clean-rename folder names now** (drop spaces + `_FWIZ*/_SMC` suffixes). Individual data
  *filenames* stay as-is this pass (many near-duplicates exist; deferred).
- **FireSpread helpers stay sourced from `../FireSpread/tests/testthat/` for now** — exporting
  them properly from the package is TODO #1 below, done as its own small task.

Verification tooling: `/usr/bin/Rscript` — `parse()` for syntax, `file.exists()` for data,
light `source()` only for dependency-free libs.

## Task checklist

- [x] **T0** — This file + `R/config.R` (machine-local/external paths in one place).
- [x] **T1** — `R/` libraries: `fortnight_functions.R`, `mcmc_functions_smc.R`,
      `flammability_indices_functions.R` + its 2 `.rds` into `data/flammability_indices/`.
      Confirmed `mcmc_functions_smc.R` is self-contained — despite the header comment ("inherits
      from mcmc_functions.R"), it has no `source()` call and defines every function itself
      (`update_lm`, `update_corr`, `update_truncnorm`, `update_ranef`, `update_steps`,
      `update_stepsU`, the `logit_scaled*` family). `R/mcmc_functions.R` was **not** copied.
      All three files verified by actually `source()`-ing them (not just `parse()`), including
      `flammability_indices_functions.R` reading its `.rds` through the store symlink.
- [x] **T2** — Store inputs copy (`data/` folders, Reference B). 9.8G copied. Went beyond a
      blind `cp -r`: grep-verified which files are actually read by canonical scripts before
      copying, and excluded what wasn't (see below) — cheaper to decide now than to migrate and
      later wonder why a 4GB folder is unused.
      - `focal_fires/` (renamed from `focal fires data/`): `fire_size_data.{rds,csv}`,
        `raw_gee/` (renamed from `raw data from GEE/`, 58 files), `landscapes/`. **Excluded:**
        `defensa_tesis_extra/` (13M, thesis-defense presentation tifs, unreferenced),
        `gam_terms_to_include.{csv,xls}` and `fwi_values_ig-known.rds` (unreferenced by any
        canonical script).
      - `pnnh_images/`: copied only the 14 files actually referenced by canonical scripts
        (grep-verified across `landscapes_preparation.R`, `hierarchical_fit`, `simulate.R`,
        `probability_maps.R`, `plots.R`) — 3.3G. **Excluded** unreferenced multi-resolution/
        exploratory variants: `pnnh_data_300m.tif(.aux.xml)`, `_60m.tif`, bare `_30m.tif` and
        `_30m_std.tif` (only the `_buff_10000` variants are read), `_spread_buffered_120m.tif.tif`,
        `visualizing_images_scale.qgz`, and the WindNinja `_cld.asc/.prj` (only `_ang`/`_vel` are
        read for PNNH) — saved ~1.3G.
      - `protected_areas/`, `ignition/`, `fwi_daily_1998-2022/`: copied wholesale (small, all
        confirmed canonical).
      - `fwi_projections/`: copied wholesale **except** the three `_OLD`/`__old` superseded
        folders (`fwi_fortnights_standardized_modern_compare_OLD`,
        `fwi_fortnights_standardized_OLD`,
        `Quilcaille_Batibeniz_2023_database-nw_patagonia_clipped__old`) — saved ~1.9G, kept 4.7G
        incl. the 4.3G Quilcaille/Batibeniz CMIP6 database (confirmed read by
        `fwi_projections.R`'s `proj_dir`).
      - External `patagonian_fires.shp` (+ sidecars) copied from
        `~/Insync/patagonian_fires/patagonian_fires/` into `data/patagonian_fires/`.
      - Verified: full store tree listed, plus `file.exists()` spot-checks through the repo's
        `data` symlink for one representative path per folder — all `TRUE`.
- [x] **T3** — Store outputs copy (`files/` folders, Reference B). ~5.0G copied.
      - `hierarchical_model/` (from `hierarchical_model_FWIZ_SMC/`, 267M, 21 files, no `dump/`) —
        copied wholesale, **plus** `fwi_mean_sd_spread.rds` brought in from the **legacy**
        `hierarchical_model_FWIZ/` (non-SMC) folder. Reason: the canonical SMC fit script
        (`hierarchical model fitting_FWIZ2_SMC.R` line 660) has the `saveRDS()` for this file
        **commented out**, so it's never produced by the canonical pipeline — yet
        `fire_regime_simulations_FWIZ.R` (line 830) reads it. This is real pre-existing tech
        debt, not something introduced by the migration; see TODO #4 below — flagged rather
        than silently fixed, per the behavior-preserving-now principle. The rest of
        `hierarchical_model_FWIZ/` (its other 20 files + its `dump/` subfolder, which differs
        from its parent — a stale backup) was **not** copied: it's the legacy non-SMC fit,
        superseded by the SMC output.
      - `posterior_samples_stage1/` (from `posterior_samples_stage1_smc/`, 294M) — copied
        wholesale; clean, no `_exploration`/`-BACKUP` variants mixed in.
      - `ignition/` (from `ignition_FWIZ/`, 138M) — copied wholesale, including some
        alternative-spec model variants (`*_ordinal`, `*_time-only1/2`, `*_relative_raw`)
        alongside the two canonically-read files (`ignition_model_samples.rds`,
        `escape_model_samples.rds`); none are `_OLD`/`dump`-labeled so kept for provenance.
      - `fire_regime_simulation/` (from `fire_regime_simulation_FWIZ/`, 4.2G, 220 files) —
        copied wholesale; clean, no `_OLD`/`-EXPONENTIAL`/`_OLD_BUG` variants mixed in (those
        sibling folders exist in the old repo but were correctly excluded, per Reference B).
      - `landscape_flammability/` (72M, same name) — copied wholesale; not produced by any
        script in the canonical migration set (a leaf input, like the fixed CSVs in `data/`).
      - Verified: sizes match source folders; store `files/` tree listed; spot-checked
        `file.exists()` through the repo's `files` symlink.
- [x] **T4** — `data_prep/flammability_indices.R` (+ its `flammability_indices.stan` model,
      copied alongside since it's code, not store data). Path edits: `"flammability indices"`
      → `"flammability_indices"` (5 data read/write sites); `stan_model(...)` path updated to
      `data_prep/flammability_indices.stan`; external veg xlsx read replaced with
      `config$veg_equiv_xlsx` + a `# TODO(migration #2)` comment (added `source(R/config.R)`).
      Surfaced two more store gaps while reading the script, both filled: the input
      `ndvi_regional_points.shp` (+ sidecars, not yet copied in T2) and two of the script's own
      legitimate outputs already computed in the old repo — `flammability_indices_samples.rds`
      (21.9M Stan fit) and `ndvi_elevation_summary.rds` — carried over so the ~24-min Stan fit
      doesn't need re-running. Other files in that old data folder
      (`ndvi_effects_samples.rds`, `ndvi_ts_detrend.*`, `ndvi_images-by-summer.csv`,
      `ndvi_optim_and_proportion.rds`) are unreferenced by this script and were left out.
      **Verified:** `parse()` OK; grep audit clean (no leftover `"flammability indices"`/`/home/`);
      actually ran the script up through both store-backed reads
      (`ndvi_detrender_model.rds`, `ndvi_regional_points.shp`, both load through the symlink);
      confirmed `config$veg_equiv_xlsx` correctly resolves to **missing** (TODO #2, expected,
      not a new bug); separately compiled `flammability_indices.stan` at its new path with
      `stan_model()` — succeeds (only a pre-existing, harmless "incomplete final line" warning
      from the stan file itself). Full end-to-end run is blocked on TODO #2 (the xlsx).
- [x] **T5** — `data_prep/` FWI scripts (`fwi_standardize.R`, `fwi_fortnight_matrix.R` + its
      `fwi_fortnight_matrix_expquad.stan`, `fwi_projections.R`). Path edits: `source(weather/
      fortnight_functions.R)` → `R/fortnight_functions.R` (all 3); external
      `patagonian_fires.shp` absolute path → `data/patagonian_fires/patagonian_fires.shp`;
      `stan_model()` path updated (`fwi_fortnight_matrix.R`).
      - **Surfaced a systemic gap**: T2 only copied the **folders** listed in Reference B —
        it never inventoried `data/`'s many **loose top-level files** (shapefiles + CSVs sitting
        directly in `data/`, not in a subfolder). `fwi_fortnight_matrix.R` needed several of
        these. Rather than patch just this task's own needs, grepped **all remaining canonical
        scripts (T6–T10)** at once for loose-file references, so this gap doesn't get
        rediscovered piecemeal later.
      - Copied for T5 itself: `ignition_points_checked.*`, `ignition_points_checked_with_date.*`
        (its own `writeVector()` is commented out — like TODO #4, it only exists because a
        prior run produced it once; needed as-is), `ignition_points_checked_with_date-fort-
        matrix-fwiz.*`, `ignition_points_checked_with_date-fort-fwiz2.*`,
        `climatic_data_by_fire_fwi-fortnight-{matrix_FWIZ,cumulative_FWIZ,cumulative_FWIZ2}.csv`.
        No filename changes — per the no-file-rename decision, only folder names are cleaned up.
      - Also copied two small items **for T6** (`climatic_data_by_fire_fwi-fortnight-
        cumulative.csv` bare, `climatic_data_by_fire_FWI-wind_corrected.csv`) and one **for T8**
        (`patagonian_fires_spread.*`) — cheap to grab now since already located by the same grep;
        avoids re-deriving this list later. `landscapes_ig-known_non-steppe.rds` (also read by
        `landscapes_preparation.R`) does **not** exist yet anywhere — it's a self-produced cache
        file (written and read by that same script), not a pre-existing input; left for T6.
      - Confirmed `data/fwi_daily_1998-2022/` was already copied **wholesale** in T2 (before
        selective copying started), so `fwi_standardize.R`'s outputs
        (`fwi_daily_..._standardized.tif`, `fwi_fortnights_..._standardized.tif`) were already
        in the store — verified by exact byte-size match against the source folder, no re-copy
        needed.
      - **Verified:** parse() OK for all 3; grep audit clean (no `/home/`, no leftover
        `weather/fortnight_functions.R` source); actually loaded every data dependency through
        the store symlink with `terra` (`apn_limites` 55 features, `patagonian_fires` 238,
        `fwi_fortnights` raster 676 layers — all load); separately compiled
        `fwi_fortnight_matrix_expquad.stan` at its new path — succeeds. Full script runs are
        long-running (fortnight aggregation, ~150-model-member projection loop) and were not
        executed end-to-end — only the data-loading and stan-compile surface was verified,
        consistent with the plan's verification bar.
- [x] **T6** — `data_prep/landscapes_preparation.R`. The biggest script so far. Path edits:
      `gee_dir` → `data/focal_fires/raw_gee`; `"flammability indices"` → `"flammability_indices"`
      (2 sites); `"focal fires data"` → `"focal_fires"` (the landscapes-output write); veg xlsx
      → `config$veg_equiv_xlsx` (+ TODO #2 comment); PNNH elevation absolute path → repo-relative
      `file.path("data","pnnh_images",...)`; `windninja_dir` assignment → `config$windninja_dir`
      (single source of truth, tech debt #5) — this alone doesn't cover it, though: the
      **`system()`/`unlink()` calls had the absolute WindNinja path baked directly into the
      shell-command string**, not routed through the `windninja_dir` variable — 3 separate
      sites (2 active, 1 commented) rewritten to build the path from `windninja_dir` via
      `file.path()`/`paste0()` instead. Added the required
      `# TODO(refactor): loop → function` marker at the landscape-building loop (deferred, item
      #5). Left one already-commented dead-code line (`"focal fires data", "wind ninja
      files", ...`) untouched — inactive, not part of Reference C's scope.
      - **Flagged, not fixed** (behavior-preserving): line 99's `mval <- mean(r)` looks like a
        pre-existing inconsistency — `r` is a SpatRaster, not the numeric vector `v` extracted
        just above it, whereas the equivalent PNNH-section code later in the same script
        correctly uses `mean(v, na.rm = T)`. Possibly a latent bug in the original script; not
        altered since this migration makes no logic changes.
      - Confirmed the `raw_gee` file count is **57**, not "58" as I'd noted from memory earlier
        in this conversation — verified against the old repo directly (also 57, byte-identical
        filenames); my earlier count was off by one (a `find` without `-type f` had included
        the directory itself). No copy gap — T2's copy was already complete.
      - **Verified:** parse() OK; grep audit clean except the one intentionally-untouched dead
        comment; actually sourced both `source()` lines (`R_spread_functions.R` — confirmed
        `land_cube` available; `flammability_indices_functions.R`); loaded the first of the 57
        raw GEE tifs with `terra` (7 named layers); confirmed every other data dependency
        resolves through the store symlink (`file.exists()` — the loose CSVs/shapefile, the
        flammability rds, the PNNH buffered raster + wind ascii grids, both pre-computed PNNH
        landscape outputs, the focal-fire `landscapes/` output dir). Confirmed both blockers
        fire exactly where expected: `config$windninja_dir` doesn't exist (TODO #3) and
        `config$veg_equiv_xlsx` doesn't exist (TODO #2) — the script cannot run past vegetation-
        transform/WindNinja setup until those are resolved, consistent with T4's finding.
- [x] **T7** — `src/sample_triplets_weighted.cpp` (no edits — no filesystem paths inside) +
      `spread/stage1_smc.R`. Path edits: `sourceCpp()` → `src/sample_triplets_weighted.cpp`;
      `data_dir` → `data/focal_fires/landscapes`; `target_dir` → `files/posterior_samples_stage1`
      (3 assignment sites + the loop's partial/full-save/cleanup paths); `"flammability
      indices"` → `"flammability_indices"`; `"focal fires data"` → `"focal_fires"` for
      `fire_size_data.{rds,csv}` (both active reads **and** their paired commented
      compute/cache lines — unlike T6's abandoned dead-code line, these are a live
      compute-once-cache-forever pattern, so leaving the commented half stale would silently
      break a future re-run of the cache-computing block).
      - **Found and resolved a real naming collision** (see TODO #5, new): the script's tail
        end compares its SMC output against `files/posterior_samples_stage1/` (bare name) —
        but in the *old* repo that bare name belonged to a **different, legacy** folder: the
        output of `sampling_fire_wise_posteriors_IMPORTANCE.R`, explicitly marked "not used" in
        `INVENTORY.md` §6. This migration's rename map assigns that same bare name to the
        **SMC** folder instead (dropping the `_smc` suffix, Reference B). Mechanically renaming
        `target_dir_imp` the same way would have made the script silently **compare the SMC
        output against itself** — a real correctness bug, not just a cosmetic one. Confirmed
        via `INVENTORY.md` that the importance-sampling script is legacy/unused, so its data was
        correctly never migrated. Resolution: **commented out both comparison blocks** (~30
        lines) with an explanatory header, rather than inventing a new name for non-canonical,
        non-migrated data or leaving a silently-wrong active reference.
      - **Verified, going beyond parse-checking**: actually compiled
        `sample_triplets_weighted.cpp` at its new path *and ran it* on a real weight vector
        (correct 4×3 output); sourced the FireSpread helper (`land_cube` available);
        `library(FireSpread)` loads with `simulate_fire_compare`/`overlap_spatial` (the
        package functions this script's similarity functions call) both present; every data
        dependency resolves through the store symlink — `landscapes/` (57 files, matching the
        57 focal fires), `fire_size_data.rds`, `flammability_indices.rds`, and
        `posterior_samples_stage1/` (58 files: 57 per-fire `full_samples_history_*.rds` + the
        merged `samples_all_fires.rds` — exactly matching T3's copy). The multi-day SMC
        sampling loop itself was not run end-to-end.
- [ ] **T8** — `spread/hierarchical_fit.R`.
- [ ] **T9** — `ignition_escape/fit.R`.
- [ ] **T10** — `fire_regime/` (`simulate.R`, `probability_maps.R`, `plots.R`).
- [ ] **T11** — Global audit (repo-wide grep + sourcing smoke tests) + close out.

## Reference B — store folder rename map (copy canonical only)

Copy into `~/Insync/fire-regime-sim-patagonia-store/…`. Only the **canonical** folder is
copied (ignore `_OLD`, other suffix variants, and already-superseded legacy dirs).

| Old relative | New relative in store |
|---|---|

| *(external, MISSING)* vegetation-equivalences `.xlsx` | `data/vegetation_equivalences.xlsx` — **TODO #2** |

## Reference C — path-edit rules (apply to every migrated script)

Robust string replacements; verify with grep after each file.

- **Source redirects:**
  `file.path("spread","mcmc_functions_SMC.R")` → `file.path("R","mcmc_functions_smc.R")`;
  `file.path("flammability indices","flammability_indices_functions.R")` → `file.path("R","flammability_indices_functions.R")`;
  `file.path("weather","fortnight_functions.R")` → `file.path("R","fortnight_functions.R")`;
  `sourceCpp(file.path("spread","sample_triplets_weighted.cpp"))` → `…file.path("src",…)`.
- **FireSpread source line:** keep
  `source(file.path("..","FireSpread","tests","testthat","R_spread_functions.R"))` **unchanged**;
  add a comment `# TODO(firespread-export): drop once rast_from_mat/land_cube exported — see docs/migration.md #1`.
- **Data folder tokens:** `"focal fires data"`→`"focal_fires"`; `"raw data from GEE"`→`"raw_gee"`;
  `"flammability indices"` (in *data* paths only) → `"flammability_indices"`;
  `"hierarchical_model_FWIZ_SMC"`→`"hierarchical_model"`; `"hierarchical_model_FWIZ"`→`"hierarchical_model"`
  ⚠️ *(simulate.R reads `_FWIZ`, fit writes `_FWIZ_SMC`; both collapse to `hierarchical_model` —
  confirm simulate.R should use the SMC fit; see TODO #4)*;
  `"posterior_samples_stage1_smc"`→`"posterior_samples_stage1"`; `"ignition_FWIZ"`→`"ignition"`;
  `"fire_regime_simulation_FWIZ"`→`"fire_regime_simulation"`.
- **Hardcoded absolute paths → `R/config.R` or store-relative:**
  WindNinja dir `/home/ivan/windninja_cli_fire_spread_files` → `config$windninja_dir`;
  veg xlsx `/home/ivan/Insync/…/clases de vegetacion y equivalencias.xlsx` → `config$veg_equiv_xlsx`;
  PNNH elev absolute path → `file.path("data","pnnh_images","pnnh_data_spread_elevation_30m.tif")`;
  external patagonian_fires absolute → `file.path("data","patagonian_fires","patagonian_fires.shp")`.

---

## Global verification (end state — T11)

1. `grep -rnE '/home/|_FWIZ|focal fires data' <repo> --include=*.R` → only allowed TODO comments.
2. `grep -rn 'tests.*testthat' <repo> --include=*.R` → only the one FireSpread `source()` line per script.
3. `Rscript -e 'source("R/config.R"); source("R/fortnight_functions.R"); source("R/flammability_indices_functions.R")'` → no error.
4. `Rscript -e 'Rcpp::sourceCpp("src/sample_triplets_weighted.cpp")'` → compiles.
5. Every migrated script `parse()`s; every `file.path("data"/"files", …)` read target resolves
   via the symlinks (`file.exists()` spot-checks).
6. A cheap end-to-end smoke run when convenient — deferred, not required to close the migration.

Originals in `fire_spread/` remain untouched throughout; deletion happens only after the user
confirms the new repo runs.

---

## Deferred TODO register

1. **FireSpread helper export** — move `rast_from_mat()`, `land_cube()` + constants from
   `FireSpread/tests/testthat/R_spread_functions.R` into `FireSpread/R/` (auto-exported by the
   package's `exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+")`), `document()` + rebuild; then drop the
   `source(…)` line from the 4 scripts that use it and rely on `library(FireSpread)`. The R
   reference reimplementations in that file (`simulate_fire_r()`, `spread_one_cell_r()`) stay
   test-only — the pipeline never calls them (confirmed by grep).
2. **Vegetation-equivalences `.xlsx` missing** — original WWF/Lara file
   (`Mapa vegetación WWF - Lara et al. 1999/clases de vegetacion y equivalencias.xlsx`) is gone
   from disk; only a different *ciefap* variant exists
   (`Mapa vegetación ciefap/clases de vegetacion y equivalencias_ciefap.xlsx`). User to
   locate/confirm the correct file → copy to `data/vegetation_equivalences.xlsx`. Until then,
   the 4 scripts that read it (`landscapes_preparation.R`, `ignition_escape/fit.R`,
   `data_prep/flammability_indices.R`, `fire_regime/simulate.R`) can't run past that line.
3. **WindNinja dir** — machine-local scratch dir, absent on this machine; only needed to
   *regenerate* wind layers (already baked into the prepared landscape `.rds` files, so not a
   blocker for most of the pipeline). All uses now derive from `config$windninja_dir`
   (`R/config.R`), including the 3 `system()`/`unlink()` shell-command strings in
   `landscapes_preparation.R` that used to hardcode the absolute path directly (fixed in T6).
4. **`fwi_mean_sd_spread.rds` isn't actually produced by the canonical fit** — resolved during
   T3: the `saveRDS()` for it in the canonical `hierarchical model fitting_FWIZ2_SMC.R` (line
   660) is **commented out**, so the file only exists because a legacy non-SMC run
   (`hierarchical model fitting_FWIZ.R`) produced it. `fire_regime/simulate.R` needs it (reads
   it from `hierarchical_model_FWIZ` in the old repo). For the migration, the file was copied
   from the legacy folder into the new `files/hierarchical_model/` alongside the canonical SMC
   outputs (data-only carry-over, no code change). **Real open question for T8/T10:** should
   `hierarchical_fit.R` uncomment that write and regenerate this artifact from the SMC fit
   (statistically more correct — it'd reflect the actual model being used), or is reusing the
   legacy artifact fine because it's just an FWI standardization constant, independent of which
   fit produced it? Needs a decision when those scripts are migrated, not before.
5. **`posterior_samples_stage1` name collision — resolved during T7.** In the old repo, the
   bare `files/posterior_samples_stage1/` belonged to the **legacy** importance-sampling stage-1
   output (`sampling_fire_wise_posteriors_IMPORTANCE.R`, "not used" per this doc's history and
   the old `INVENTORY.md` §6) — a *different* folder from `posterior_samples_stage1_smc/`
   (canonical). This migration's clean-rename drops the `_smc` suffix, so the canonical SMC
   folder now also has the bare name — colliding with the legacy folder's old identity. Since
   the legacy data was correctly never migrated (non-canonical), `stage1_smc.R`'s tail-end
   comparison against it (comparing SMC vs. importance-sampling overlap) was **commented out**
   rather than silently pointed at the SMC folder itself (which would have made it compare the
   SMC output against itself — a real bug, not just stale code). Re-derive from the archived old
   repo if that comparison is ever needed again.
6. **Refactors (post-verification, not part of this migration):**
   - `landscapes_preparation.R` loop → function (build any landscape, not a hard-coded loop).
   - Split `hierarchical_fit.R` monolith — algorithm core vs. inline data manipulation.
   - Extract `recalibrate.R` + `simulator.R` (standalone function) out of `fire_regime/simulate.R`.
   - Fill `docs/*.md` deep detail per module as each is refactored (docs strategy: fill during
     migration/refactor, not up front).
